Each problem is a folder.

It will have set_up_env.sh, evaluate.sh, and download_datasets.sh

download_datasets.sh is called before evaluation to download/extract datasets to a local cache directory

set_up_env.sh is called in the beginning to create the env for the problem. It uses pre-downloaded datasets from the mounted cache if available.

evaluate.sh is called at the end. It assumes that there is a solution_env in ../execution_env and a solution.py in solution_env

evaluate.sh returns a number as the score.

Each problem need to specify the following: 
1. what the env looks like.
2. The input and output format for solution.py
3. How datasets are downloaded and used (via download_datasets.sh and set_up_env.sh)
